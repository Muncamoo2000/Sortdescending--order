# SortDecending-order
A fun beginner project taking an array and arranging it in descending order. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-sort-an-array-in-descending-order-using-stl-in-c/
This was a tutoria but I never copy and paste. When I write the code I always find errors in what I have done. This program was pretty strait forward and I used a nested for loop to cycle through the array.
